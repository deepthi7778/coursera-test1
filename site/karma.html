<span> <p class="para1 para2">
Karma simply means action. Every action has consequences. Conscious choice-making is the most effective way of creating future consequences of karma. Karma creates the future, but it is also an echo from the past. Karma conditions our soul through memory, desire and imagination. Most people are prisoners of karma, because it becomes a conditioned reflex and produces predictable outcomes in their lives. It is equivalent to Newton’s law of ‘every action must have a reaction’.

	<span id="sub2">punar-mrtyu (re-death), punar-asu (coming to life again) and punarajati (rebirth) </span>are used to denote it.[6] Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain punar-mrtyu verses of Rigveda to be discussing "repeated deaths"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in "come home once again
