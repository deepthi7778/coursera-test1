The earliest appearance of the word<span id="sub2"> karma </span>is found in the Rigveda. The term karma also appears significantly in the Veda. According to <span id="sub2"> Brahmanas</span>, "as his wife man is born to the world he has made" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.[3] Scholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the <span id="sub2">Brhadaranyaka</span>, which is the earliest of the Upanishads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death

<p  class="para2">
	The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the<span id="sub1"> Rig Veda</span>.[5] The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the Brāhmaṇas, where words like 
	<span id="sub1">punar-mrtyu (re-death), punar-asu (coming to life again) and punarajati (rebirth) </span>are used to denote it.[6] Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain punar-mrtyu verses of Rigveda to be discussing "repeated deaths"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in "come home once again
